# Bluetooth Device Connector

This AutoHotkey script aims to automatically connect a specific Bluetooth device to your Windows computer. It is particularly useful for devices like Bluetooth headphones or speakers, enabling quick and hassle-free connection.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed on your Windows system to run the script. Additionally, your computer must have Bluetooth capabilities, and the appropriate drivers must be installed and functioning correctly.

## Usage

1. Modify the `deviceName` variable in the script with the name of the Bluetooth device you want to connect to.
2. Run the script by double-clicking the file or using AutoHotkey to execute it.

Once launched, the script will search for the specified Bluetooth device and attempt to connect to it. If the device is found and the connection is successful, you will receive a connection notification.

## Origin

This script originated from the need to quickly and automatically connect Apple AirPods headphones to Windows, as the connection process was somewhat cumbersome.
